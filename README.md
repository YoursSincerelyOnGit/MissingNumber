* Task: I had to develop a method to find the missing number in the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10] by analyzing the numerical sequence.
* Approach: I iterated through the array, comparing each element to the expected sequence number (i + 1), and output the first mismatch.
* Result: The code outputs 8 as the missing number (see question4ResultsScreenshot.jpeg).
* Challenges: The solution assumes a nearly consecutive sequence starting at 1. A sum-based approach could handle non-standard sequences more efficiently.
* Source Code Reference: The method FindMissingNumber in MissingNumberFinder.cs uses iterative comparison.
